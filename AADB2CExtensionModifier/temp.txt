# TODO - Set up AAD auth, including refreshing the token. Probably an auth library

Business Logic:
	Send the user to the browser to log in and get a token
	Use the token to get the available B2C tenants somehow
		Alternatively, have the user enter the tenant and client ID for an existing app reg manually, 
		then use that to get the rest.
	Populate the dropdown with the available tenants, and allow the user to select one
	Once the user has selected a tenant, get the app registrations for that tenant.
		Get the app registration for B2C extension attributes
		Get the extension attributes for the app registration
		Parse the clientID from the app reg, remove the hyphens, and store it.
	Have a field for a user to look up a user by full name or email, then select one.
	Populate a table with the extension attributes of the selected user and allow the user to modify the values
		Validate that the values are the correct type
		Allow the user to save the values back to the user (save button)


UI:
	- Dropdown for selecting the tenant (or text input for tenant ID and client ID(probably better))
	- Table for displaying the extension attributes
	- Save button
	- Error message display (popups?)
	- Loading spinner
	- Logout button
	- Login button
